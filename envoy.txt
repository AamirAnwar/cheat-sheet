*** Envoy ***

Reverse proxy is a type of proxy which can direct an incoming client request and forward it to the server that can fulfill it.

Load balancer (Synchornous Decoupling)
Can route traffic based on the HTTP path
Replace instances based on health checks

- Connection Draining
- Health checks


Pricing

Pay for every hour your ALB runs
Pay for number of Load Balancer Capacity Units

LCU
	New connection : 1 LCU for every 25 requests per second
	Active Connections : 1 LCU for every 3000 active connections per minute
	Bandwidth : 1 LCU for 2.22 Mbps
	Only billed for the dimension with the highest number
	Price = hours + n(LCU)

Health checks
	Interval - How often to perform health checks
	Timeout - timeout < interval
	Health Threshold - Number of successful health check callbacks after which a target is called healthy
	Unhealthy -  Number of unsuccessful health check callbacks after which a target is called unhealthy

Distributed systems best practices - 
retry, rate limiting, circuit breaking and timeouts

Envoy is a an out of process architecture

Envoy is an L3/L4 proxy. Can be used for raw bytes being sent over TCP, redis, mongo etc
HTTP L7 filter architecture
HTTP/2 proxy first 

Performs Service Discovery
Active[Send health check calls] and Passive[Look at traffic] health checking 
Advanced load balancing - Shadowing, retry, kickass algorithms, stats:logging:tracing
Authorisation and Authentication
Edge proxy 
Historically, people put nginx at the edge and use HAProxy in the middle
Also the edge proxy and middle proxy perform 99% similar tasks
