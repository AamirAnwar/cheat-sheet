*** Notes ***
file descriptors are numbers which represent open files
Linux represents everything as a file
/dev/null : Null device
tgz means a tar file which has been compressed with gzip
DO NOT USE SPACES when naming
*Learn window management*
*Become kickass at vim*
*Practice regular expressions*
If a file has executable permissions set, its most likely an executable
/etc/passwd contains all the accounts on a linux system
Env customisation - $PS1 and $prompt env variables
bash_profile is the main config file for the bash shell
Ctrl-c kills the current foreground process
ctrl-z suspends the current foreground process
current job = Last job that was stopped in foreground or the last job that was started in the background
& starts a job in the background eg - ./long_running &
When you start a job in the background, the job number and pid are sent to stdout
%% or %+ represent the current job
%- is the previous job
Cron - time based scheduling system that starts when the system boots
/etc/sudoers contains a list of users and what commands those users can run 
Bash keeps history in memory and only writes to disk on exit - [~/.bash_history, ~/.history, ~/.histfile]
RPM Package format - RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, Oracle Linux, Scientific Linux
To install or remove software you need root privileges 
DEB distros - Debian, Linux mint and Ubuntu and use apt(advanced packaging tool) as their package manager

*** Linux boot process *** 

BIOS [Basic input/output system]
Special firmware
First piece of software that is run when a computer is powered on
Operating system independent
It tests the underlying hardware and to load the bootloader
Performs a POST (Power on self test)  - Performs basic checks on hardware components such as the CPU, Memory and 
Storage devices.
Only if POST succeeds does the BIOS load the bootloader
BIOS knows about all the bootable devices - Hard disks, USB drives and DVD drives. The search order can be changed for devices


*** Bootloaders ***
GRUB Bootloader - Grand unified bootloader
Older systems can use the LILO (Linux Loader) bootloader 
Bootloaders start the operating system with different options if needed

Initial RAM disk (initrd) - A temporary file system which is loaded into memory when the system boots
Contains helpers which perform hardware detection and load the necessary modules (drivers) required to load the permanent OS file system 

If the root filesystem is stored on a LVM(Logical Volume Manager) Volume the initrd image will contain the kernel modules required to mount that logical volume as the root file system

Once the root filesystem is mounted, initrd's task is done and the OS continues loading from the real file system

/boot contains initrd, kernel, bootloader config and any files needed to boot the OS 
Kernal is present as vmlinux or vmlinuz(compressed)
Kernel ring buffer contains messages from the linux kernel
/var/log/dmesg contains the full set of logs from system boot

*** Runlevels ***
Linux uses run levels to determine which processes and services to start
Run levels 0-6
Run levels were controlled by the init program
/etc/inittab -> init config
Use systemd instead (upstart is another option)
Systemd uses targets instead which are listed in /lib/systemd/system


*** Logging ***
Linux uses the syslog standard for message logging
Categorise messages based on facility and severity
Syslog servers - syslogd, rsyslog, syslog-ng
rsyslog config - /etc/rsyslog.conf
Include additional config file using $IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
Logging rules - Selector field and Action field
Selector field format - FACILITY.SEVERITY
eg - mail.* /var/log/mail.log : Write mail logs of any severity to this path
eg - mail.* -/var/log/mail.log : Don't sync for every log operation. Called caching mode and it improves I/O performance. May lose logs if system crashes
Less critical messages can use caching
fdisk, gdisk, parted : Disk partitioning utils
Use logger to test new configs or generate logs from your own shell scripts

*** Disk Management *** 
Partitioning - dividing a disk into parts
	Paritioning scheme eg - 1) OS, 2) User home directories
	Protects the overall system
	Prevents a user program from using up all the memory which will interfere with system processes

MBR - Master boot record : is a boot sector at the beginning of a storage device
	The partition table dictates how the logical partitions are made on the disk 
	Can only address 2TB of disk space so being phased out by the GPT (GUID Partition table)
	Max 4 primary partitions
	Extended partitions allow for logical partitions

GPT - GUID Partition table
	Part of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface standard
	UEFI is replacing BIOS
	Supports up to 128 partitions
	Supports storage devices up to 9.4ZB
	Not supported everywhere yet

Mount point is a directory used to access data on a partition 

*** File systems *** 
Before a partition can be used on a linux system it needs a file system
ext4 was created for linux. ZFS is another example
ls -l /sbin/mkfs* prints out all the file system builders. Can use man for all these
Making mounts permanent requires editing /etc/fstab
fstab columns - (device, mount point, file system type, mount options, dump, fsck order)
Each file system type has a util that allows you to modify the label assigned to it
The GECOS field
All shells are in /etc/shells
/etc/skel contains shell config files
/etc/group file has group details
/etc/gsahdow passwords for groups


*** LVM ***
// A full lecture on its own


*** User management ***
Each user account on a linux system is associated with a UID and a username
Each account has a default group to which it belongs, a shell to execute when the user logs into the system and a home directory
/etc/passwd stores configs for each user
First entry in /etc/passwd is the root user
Format in /etc/passwd - username:password:{user_id}:{default group_id}:comments:home_dir:shell 
Keep the usernames less than 8 characters
/etc/shadow contains the encrypted passwords
UID for root is 0
System accounts have UID < 1000 [configured through /etc/logins.defs]
To prevent interactive use of an account, use /usr/bin/nologin or /bin/false as the shell is /etc/passwd for that user
Shell field can also be used to execute a program which can force users into a menu driven application that only allows them access to certain actions
 /etc/shadow format - {username}:{encrypted password}:{number of days since the password has been changed}:{number of days before the password can be changed}:{number of days before the password must be changed}: {number of days to warn the user that their password will expire}:{number of days after the password has expired that the account is disabled}:{number of days that an account has been disabled}: {Reserved}


Group details are stored in the /etc/group file
First entry is the root group 
format - group_name:password:GID:account1,accountN
Passwords are stored /etc/gshadow file


*** Networking *** 
127.0.0.1 is the loopback address
A host is a device connected to a network
FQDN - Domain name and top level domain name [Fully Qualified Domain Name] : webprod.comany.com
TLD - Top level domain : .com, .org
Subdomains - webprod.ny.us.company.com
Change /etc/hostname to change the hostname
host and dig can resolve a hostname or an ipaddress
Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf to change the order in which look ups are performed
NSS = Name service switch
Ports identify the services on a host
When a service starts on a system it binds itself to a port on the system and listens for traffic on its port
Port range - 1 to 65535
1 - 1023 = Well known/System ports. Requires sudo to open these ports 
/etc/services translates human readable names into port numbers

Ping sends ICMP packets
tcpdump - packet sniffer


*** Special Permissions ***
Setuid - Start the process assuming the role of the process owner 
When you start a process it starts with your UID and GID
chsh, ping and /etc/passwd use setuid
Setuid Does not work with shell scripts
permission bit 4777 is really really bad
to find all the files with the setgid permission bit set do find / -perm /2000 -ls
child directories inherit gid from parent directories
Great for working with groups. Allows you to centrally manage group related permissions
Tripwire - file integrity checker
AIDE, OSSSEC, Samhain, Package managers can help in identifying vulnerable files
Sticky bit - Used on a directory to only allow the directory, file owner or the root user to rename or delete the file


*** Shell script ***
Commands listed in a shell script are executed by an interpreter, which here is the shell itself
before you can execute a shell script it should have the executable bit set. chmod 755 script.sh
#! -> shebang
#! tells the what the interpreter is for this script
Executing a shell script internally just converts to <interpreter> <path to script>
Enclose variables in quotes to avoid side effects when performing tests
sudo !! : Repeat as root
!* : Take all arguments from the previous command
!$ : Last item interacted with in a command line
sshd - SSH daemon or server process
sticky bit
If a permission letter is in caps then it means that the bit is NOT set


TODO 
Can't explain Run Levels
Learn about systemctl and systemd
Whats a RAID 1?
sudo service sshd start - what is service
Need to practice shell scripting
